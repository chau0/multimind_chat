# Frontend-Backend Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### Frontend Service Layer
1. Updated `chatService.ts` to use the correct backend API endpoints:
   - Changed API base URL to `/api/v1`
   - Updated message endpoints to match backend structure
   - Added session ID support
   - Added response transformation to match frontend expected format

2. Updated React Hooks:
   - Modified `useChat.ts` to support session IDs and use the correct API endpoints
   - Updated `useAgents.ts` to use the correct API endpoint

3. Updated TypeScript Types:
   - Added `sessionId` property to `SendMessageRequest` interface

### API Proxy
1. Added proxy middleware in `routes.ts` to forward requests to the backend:
   - Set up proxy for `/api/v1` path
   - Maintained fallback routes for local development
   - Added error handling for proxy requests

2. Added required dependencies:
   - Added `axios` and `http-proxy-middleware` to package.json

### Configuration
1. Created environment files:
   - Added `.env` for frontend with API base URL
   - Created `.env.example` for reference

### Docker Setup
1. Created Docker Compose configuration:
   - Set up services for both frontend and backend
   - Configured environment variables
   - Set up networking between services

2. Created Dockerfile for frontend

### Documentation
1. Created README with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Environment variable requirements
   - Running instructions for both Docker and local development
   - API endpoint documentation

## API Endpoints

The integration connects the frontend to these backend endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/agents`: Get all available agents
- `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages`: Get messages for a specific chat session
- `POST /api/v1/chat/messages`: Send a message to an agent

## Next Steps

1. Test the integration with real backend services
2. Implement error handling for API failures
3. Add authentication if required
4. Implement real-time updates with WebSockets if needed
