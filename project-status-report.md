# MultiMind Project Status Report

## Project Overview
MultiMind is a multi-persona AI chat application that allows users to mention different AI "agents" in a single conversation, with each agent replying from its unique perspective while maintaining the full context of the chat. The application uses a React frontend with a FastAPI backend.

## Current Status

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1: Core Chat Skeleton
- ✅ Project setup with React + TypeScript + Vite for frontend
- ✅ Basic chat UI implementation with message bubbles, input area, and agent selector
- ✅ Mention parser implementation (`@AgentName` syntax)
- ✅ Frontend components for chat window, message bubbles, and input field

#### Phase 2: Agent Engine & Routing
- ✅ Backend API setup with FastAPI
- ✅ Agent definitions and repository implementation
- ✅ Basic LLM service integration with Azure OpenAI
- ✅ Message handling and routing based on agent mentions

#### Phase 3: Persistence & Memory (Partial)
- ✅ Database schema and models for agents, chat sessions, and messages
- ✅ Repository layer for data access
- ✅ Basic session management for conversations

#### Integration
- ✅ Frontend-Backend API integration
- ✅ API proxy setup for development
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose configuration for deployment
- ✅ Environment configuration for both frontend and backend

### In Progress / Next Steps

#### Phase 3: Persistence & Memory (Remaining)
- ⏳ Implement agent short-term memory
- ⏳ Add schema tests and validation

#### Phase 4: Configurable Personas & UX Polish
- ⏳ Implement Agent Settings modal for persona configuration
- ⏳ Add Markdown rendering for messages
- ⏳ Implement optimistic UI updates
- ⏳ Add error toast system for better user feedback

#### Phase 5: Security, Rate Limits & Observability
- ⏳ Add authentication (optional based on requirements)
- ⏳ Implement rate-limiting middleware
- ⏳ Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- ⏳ Set up proper secret management

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query for API state
- **Key Features**:
  - Mention-aware input field
  - Agent selector
  - Real-time typing indicators
  - Message bubbles with agent avatars

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- **Database**: SQL Server (Azure)
- **LLM Integration**: Azure OpenAI
- **Architecture**:
  - API Layer: FastAPI routers
  - Service Layer: Business logic
  - Repository Layer: Data access
  - External Services: LLM providers

### Integration Points
- Frontend communicates with backend via RESTful API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/agents`: Get all available agents
  - `GET /api/v1/chat/sessions/{session_id}/messages`: Get messages for a session
  - `POST /api/v1/chat/messages`: Send a message to an agent

## Deployment
- Docker containers for both frontend and backend
- Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Environment configuration via `.env` files

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **API Integration**: Differences between frontend expectations and backend implementations were resolved by creating a proxy middleware and adapting the frontend service layer.
2. **Session Management**: Implemented session IDs to maintain conversation context across interactions.
3. **Agent Routing**: Created a mention parser to extract agent names from messages and route them appropriately.

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Complete Phase 3**: Finish implementing agent memory and persistence features
2. **Proceed to Phase 4**: Focus on UX improvements and configurable personas
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation and user guides
5. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Timeline
- **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**: Complete Phase 3 and start Phase 4
- **Medium-term (3-4 weeks)**: Complete Phase 4 and start Phase 5
- **Long-term (5+ weeks)**: Evaluate the need for Phase 6 (Live Collaboration) and Phase 7 (Monetization) based on user feedback
