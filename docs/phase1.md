#	Action	Why it’s first	Expected output
1	Pick & lock a project name (e.g. MultiMind, ChorusAI). Check .com/.io availability and create a private GitHub repo with that slug.	Gives the project a home and keeps you from renaming files later.	github.com/your-org/multimind-chat
2	Generate an OpenAI API key (or configure your local Ollama model). Store it in a .env.local you never commit.	Unblocks first API call; saves context switching later.	OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-… in env file
3	Run npx create-next-app@latest multimind-chat and commit.	Creates working scaffold in < 5 min; lets you push green CI on day 1.	“Hello World” page loads locally.
4	Add Tailwind & basic page layout (header, empty chat column).	Sets visual skeleton so you can drop components in quickly.	/pages/index.tsx with header + placeholder chat window.
5	Create a single @DevHelper agent constant and hard-code a demo reply in the front-end (no API yet).	Lets you build the mention parser & UI without worrying about backend latency.	Typing “@DevHelper hi” echoes back “Demo reply”.
6	Implement streaming fetch hook (use fetch + ReadableStream) and a progressive text bubble. Point it at a temporary /api/local route that simply returns a slow chunked response.	Validates your token-by-token renderer before touching OpenAI.	Bubbles type out “Hello… world…” one word at a time.
7	Replace the stub with a real OpenAI streamed call (stream=True). Keep system prompt simple: “You are DevHelper, a friendly coder.”	Milestone: the first real LLM agent answering live.	Ask “How to center a div?” → see streamed answer.
8	Write a GitHub README with: setup, .env vars, “How to run”.	Enables outside testers to clone & run without questions.	README.md pushed.
9	Open an Indie Hackers or small Slack work-in-progress thread and share a screenshot GIF.	Accountability + early feedback loop before you sink weeks of effort.	First external comment or 👍 .
10	Create issues for the remaining Phase 1 tickets (1.4 – 1.10) in GitHub Projects.	Converts the plan into executable tasks you can drag to “Done”.	Board with ≈6 open issues.
