# Building a Multi-Persona AI Chat Application

This document outlines the concept, requirements, architecture, and project plan for creating a multi-persona AI chat application. The core idea is to allow a user to mention different AI "agents" in a single conversation, with each agent replying from its unique perspective while maintaining the full context of the chat.

-----

## ‚úÖ Concept & Roadmap

### Problem to Solve

Most chatbots act as a single persona, limiting perspective. This project aims to simulate multi-role collaboration in one chat interface (e.g., summoning a Product Manager, Developer, and Critic). This solves the problem of:

  * Needing diverse perspectives for brainstorming or planning.
  * Manually switching between personas or tools.
  * Losing context in single-agent AI chats.

### üéØ Target Customer

  * Indie founders and solo developers.
  * Entrepreneurs and creators seeking structured, multi-angle thinking.
  * AI power users and prompt engineers.
  * Consultants simulating internal team feedback.

### üåü Unique Selling Points

  * **Mention-based agent summoning** (e.g., `@ProductManager`, `@Critic`).
  * Agents reply with the **shared context** of the entire conversation.
  * **Persistent, customizable personas** with unique system prompts.
  * Simulates a team of expert voices without switching tools.

### üîß MVP Roadmap & Timeline

  * **Week 1:** Define 3-5 core agents (e.g., Builder, PM, Critic). Create agent definitions (roles + system prompts). Build a basic chat UI.
  * **Week 2:** Add mention parser (`@AgentName`) to the input. Route user messages to the correct agent, providing the full chat history. Render agent replies with their name/avatar.
  * **Week 3:** Add a simple memory/persistence system (e.g., SQLite or Supabase). Polish the UI and deploy to a service like Vercel or Render.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Suggestions

| Part         | Tool Suggestions                                   |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | React + Tailwind or Next.js                        |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, Node.js, or Flask                         |
| **LLM** | OpenAI GPT-4o or Mistral 7B (via Ollama or vLLM)   |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (Frontend) + Render/Fly.io (Backend)        |
| **DB** | SQLite (for MVP) or Supabase (for persistence)     |
| **Auth** | Clerk or Auth.js (for multi-user support later)    |

## üìã MoSCoW Prioritization

This framework defines what's critical for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### ‚úÖ Must-Have (Critical for MVP)

  * **Mention-based agent invocation:** Users can type `@AgentName` to trigger a specific persona.
  * **Predefined agent personas:** Agents have distinct system prompts, roles, and personalities.
  * **Shared conversation context:** Each agent receives the full chat history to inform its response.
  * **Chat UI with message display:** Clearly displays user and agent messages with names/avatars.
  * **LLM integration:** Connects to an AI model like OpenAI's GPT-4o or a local alternative.

### üü° Should-Have (Important but not urgent)

  * **Agent memory per session:** Agents remember key decisions within a single session.
  * **Configurable agent definitions:** Personas are editable via a `JSON` file or a simple UI.
  * **Typing indicator/loading state:** Provides better UI feedback to the user.
  * **Persistent conversation history:** Users can save and load previous chats.
  * **Markdown rendering:** Supports formatting like code blocks, bold text, and lists.

### üü¢ Could-Have (Nice-to-haves)

  * **Agents talking to each other:** Simulate debates with prompts like `@Agent1: what do you think?`
  * **Voice input/output:** For a more immersive, hands-free experience.
  * **Multiple chat rooms:** Users can organize discussions by project or topic.
  * **Drag-and-drop persona creator:** A no-code UI for creating new agents.
  * **Avatar customizations/themes:** Aesthetic enhancements for agent identity.

### üö´ Won‚Äôt-Have (For now)

  * User authentication & multi-user support.
  * Native mobile app (stick to responsive web).
  * Real-time multi-user collaboration in the same chatroom.
  * Agent fine-tuning or complex training.
  * Integration with external API tools (e.g., agents that can browse the web).

## üë§ User Stories

### ‚úÖ Must-Have User Stories

  * As a user, I want to **mention an agent using `@AgentName`**, so that I can get a response from a specific persona.
  * As a user, I want agents to **respond based on the full chat context**, so that I don‚Äôt have to repeat myself.
  * As a user, I want each agent to have a **distinct role/personality**, so that I get expert feedback from multiple perspectives.
  * As a user, I want to **see who is responding (agent name/avatar)**, so that I can track which persona is speaking.

### üü° Should-Have User Stories

  * As a user, I want each agent to **remember what was discussed earlier**, so that they can give coherent follow-up replies.
  * As a user, I want to **define or edit agent personas**, so that I can customize them to my use case.
  * As a user, I want to **format my messages (e.g., code blocks, bold)**, so that I can write clearer prompts.
  * As a user, I want to **review past conversations**, so that I can reference previous discussions.

### üü¢ Could-Have User Stories

  * As a user, I want agents to **respond to each other**, so that I can simulate multi-expert discussions.
  * As a user, I want to **group chats by project or topic**, so that I can manage multiple threads.

## üìÑ Lean Product Requirement Document (PRD)

### Problem

Single-persona AI chats are limited in perspective. Users wanting collaborative ideation are forced to switch tools or manually simulate multiple voices, losing context and efficiency.

### Goal

Build a lightweight web app that allows users to summon predefined AI personas using `@AgentName` mentions. Each agent replies in its role with full conversation context, simulating multi-expert collaboration in a single, fast interface.

### Users & Use Cases

  * **Primary Users:** Indie developers, solopreneurs, product designers, and AI power users.
  * **Use Cases:** Brainstorming ideas, evaluating decisions from multiple angles, simulating debates, and clarifying thoughts.

### Features

  * **Must-Have (MVP):** Mention-based agent calling, predefined personas, shared context, clean chat UI, LLM integration.
  * **Should-Have:** Session-based agent memory, editable agent config, Markdown support, chat history persistence.
  * **Could-Have (Post-MVP):** Agent-to-agent debates, project-based chat rooms, no-code persona editor.

### Success Criteria

  * **MVP Validation:** A working prototype is deployed and tested by at least 5 users who confirm it saves time or provides new insights.
  * **Post-MVP Growth:** Achieve 50+ active users, see user-created custom personas, and generate interest from the target community (e.g., Indie Hackers).

                                  [ Response ‚Üí Frontend ]
```

### Key Components

  * **Frontend (Next.js):** Manages the chat window, mention-aware input, message rendering (with Markdown), and state.
  * **Backend (FastAPI):** Exposes a `/sendMessage` endpoint that parses mentions, looks up agent configs, formats the prompt with history, and calls the LLM.
  * **Agent Config (JSON):** A simple file or database table to define agents.
    ```json
    {
      "agent_name": "ProductManager",
      "system_prompt": "You are a strategic product manager. Be concise, user-focused, and ask clarifying questions.",
      "avatar": "üìä"
    }
    ```
  * **Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL):** Stores users (optional), chats, messages, and agent definitions for persistence.
