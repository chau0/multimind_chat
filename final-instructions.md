# MultiMind Frontend-Backend Integration

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully integrated the React frontend with the FastAPI backend by:

1. **Updated API Endpoints**: Modified the frontend service layer to use the correct backend API endpoints with proper path structure.

2. **Added Session Support**: Implemented session ID support for chat messages to maintain conversation context.

3. **Created API Proxy**: Set up a proxy middleware to forward frontend requests to the backend API.

4. **Updated React Hooks**: Modified the React hooks to work with the new API structure.

5. **Added Docker Support**: Created Docker and Docker Compose configurations to run both services together.

6. **Added Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for setup and usage.

## How to Test the Integration

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Azure credentials
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Running Services Separately

#### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Verifying the Integration

1. Open the frontend application in your browser
2. You should see the list of agents loaded from the backend
3. Try sending a message with an @mention to an agent
4. The message should be sent to the backend, processed, and a response should be displayed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **API Connection Issues**: 
   - Check that the backend is running and accessible
   - Verify the BACKEND_API_URL environment variable is correct
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

2. **Missing Agents**: 
   - Ensure the database is properly seeded with agents
   - Check the backend logs for database connection issues

3. **Message Sending Failures**:
   - Verify the message format in the network tab
   - Check backend logs for processing errors

## Next Steps

1. **Add Authentication**: Implement user authentication for personalized experiences
2. **Real-time Updates**: Consider adding WebSockets for real-time message updates
3. **Persistent Storage**: Implement proper database storage for production use
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and user feedback
5. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for the integration
